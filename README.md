A simple script to determine a game's rank on steam's popular wishlist. 

Instead of opening up steam, scrolling 50 games at a time, 60-62 times, I decided to automate the process. 

Caches the findings in a file locally, and queries that file. If the file is corrupt, or deleted, it is considered evicted / invalidated and the script re fetches the total games list.
